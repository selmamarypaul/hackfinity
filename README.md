### Project Description
The Food Expiration Tracker is a web-based application designed for supermarkets to track food expiration dates, alert staff about expiring products, and facilitate food donations to nearby food banks. By using a QR code scanner, the system can quickly identify products and their expiration dates, helping reduce food waste and assist lower-income¬†families


### The Problem statement
